## 🏃‍♂️ The Pivot: From Athlete to Engineer

Before 2020, my world was defined by karate, marathons and fitness. As a graduate of the **Faculty of Sport and Physical Education**, founder of the **Running Tribe** running club, and owner of the **Reborn** fitness studio, I mastered the art of discipline, leadership, teamwork and performance under pressure.

When the pandemic hit, I channeled that same mindset into software engineering. Today, as a **Lead Frontend Engineer**, I combine peak performance principles with modern engineering to build scalable, high-end mobile and web applications.
